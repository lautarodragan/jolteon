# TODO

## Friendlier Releases

- `cargo install jolteon`
- https://webinstall.dev/

## Tree Filter/Search Improvement: Search Through Closed Nodes

- If I type `tarkus`, I want it to be selected, even if `Emerson, Lake & Palmer` is closed
- If the node is closed/collapsed, expand it when navigating to it while in search/filter mode, but collapse it again when moving the selection to another node (if that node isn't another child of `Emerson, Lake & Palmer`)

## File Browser

- Fix: update the contents of the panels when the selected folder changes
- Fix: update the contents of the playlist panel when adding files to the playlist

## Virtual directories in media library

I tried doing 3 levels in the library by manually editing the library json file and I didn't like the UX.
I'm now thinking the tree view component should always be at most two levels deep for UX to be decent, if possible;
so I need a more ergonomic way to navigate these modes.

Jumping from "normal library mode" to "soundtrack mode" is as different as doing so to "playlists", so it'd make sense to have
tabs for these, instead.

```
Library (Bands) | Library (Composers) | Library (Soundtracks) | Playlists | Queue | File Browser | Help
```

UX for adding to library TBD. Current UX for toggling between "add to library/playlist" is already pretty... not perfect,
but it'll be _terrible_ if we can add to 4 different targets.

## Configurable Skip on Paused Behavior

- Mode 1: do nothing (normal) (Jolteon stays _paused_. Adding songs to the queue or skipping songs will not start playback automatically)
- Mode 2: un-pause when stopping/skipping current song.
- Mode 3: un-pause when stopping current song, only if there are no more songs in the queue. 

## Toggle Repeat

We can currently enable REPEAT ONE with Alt+R and disable it with Alt+T. 
Support for toggling instead.

## Jolteon Idle Animation

- Store a "start_frame". Start after 2 seconds of being idle.
- Support variable frame rate.

## User Message Log Screen

- Temporarily display user messages over the _currently playing_ area ("song added to playlist", "error opening file", etc).
- After a time-out, just permanently hide that message from that area, going back to showing the usual _currently playing_ stuff.
- Store these messages permanently in a new, "log" screen.
- This log screen is unrelated to debugging logs (`log::debug`, etc). It's only for user-facing messages.

## Radio Mode / Playlist Generator / Suggestions

Some sort of engine that suggests music.
- Purely random
- "Learn" based on listening patterns (some sort of "song proximity" based on which songs we tend to listen "together", for some definition of "together")
- Radio mode: just keep playing suggested tracks after the queue ends
- Playlist generator: create a playlist of N songs
- Queue mode: like playlist mode, but adds to queue instead of creating a playlist?

## Lists Scroll Improvements

- Visual feedback when trying to move past the end/start (like the Nintendo Switch home)
- Visual indicator of there being off-screen elements in the list (we have no scroll bars)
  - First/last visible element being `${elementName} + ${remainingCount} more...`, dim'd, if `remainingCount > 0`
  - An actual scroll bar?

## Refactor: AtomicDuration

An `AtomicDuration` struct may be more ergonomic than a `Mutex<Duration>`, and might be marginally faster.

```rs
AtomicDuration { 
    seconds: AtomicU64,  
    nanos: AtomicU32, 
}
```

It also may not, and it could be marginally slower. Atomics can spin-lock, while Futexes will suspend the thread.

Still, a Mutex, in Unix, uses a Futex, that has an AtomicU32 inside, so we'd just be adding an AtomicU64 and saving us a lock.

```rs
pub struct Mutex {
    futex: Atomic,
}

pub struct Mutex {
    futex: Atomic,
}

type Atomic = futex::SmallAtomic;

pub type SmallAtomic = AtomicU32;
```

And futexes do a syscall.

All in all, it probably won't do any difference at all for Jolteon. We only lock threads on shared resources between the rendering and the playing thread,
and that only happens up to FPS on the rendering side and up to once per song in the queue or once per keyboard input, which is pretty low. Always above
1ms.

So the only difference might be in ergonomics: 

```rs
// now, with mutex:
total_time: Arc::new(Mutex::new(total_time)),
self.total_time.lock().unwrap().clone()
*self.total_time.lock().unwrap() = song_list_to_duration(&songs);

// then, with atomics:
total_time: Arc::new(AtomicDuration::from_duration(total_time)), // or Into trait?
self.total_time.clone()
self.total_time = song_list_to_duration(&songs);
```

Alternatively, since we don't really need nanosecond precision (for display and seek), nor more than... a few hours? a whole day? (for total queue length) of seconds, 
we could just store the millis as an AtomicU64, and do `Duration::from_millis()`. 
There are 86_400_000 millis in a day. The u64 max is 18446744073709551615... that is 213_503_982_334 days? Should be fine lol 
Even a U32 should give us more than 40 days, in which case we'd be using a single AtomicU32, which is what a Mutex is already using inside,
so, at worst, we'd have the same performance of the Mutex.
